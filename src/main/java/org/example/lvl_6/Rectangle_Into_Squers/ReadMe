Can you translate this drawing into an algorithm?

You will be given two dimensions

    a positive integer length (parameter named lng)
    a positive integer width (parameter named wdth)

You will return a collection or a string (depending on the language;
 Shell bash, PowerShell, Pascal and Fortran return a string) with the size of each of the squares.
